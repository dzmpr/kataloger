## Cataloger
---

Cataloger can help update your project dependencies with ease! All you need is point to `libs.versions.toml` file and supply it with repositories that you use in project.

### How to use?
#### CLI mode
Cataloger offers handy CLI mode which you can use locally or on CI.

#### Integrate cataloger to your python script
Cataloger has convenient API (I did my best), so you can install it from `pip` and use in any script.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support check multiple catalogs
